**Purpose of Analysis:** 
Since ChatGPT's public release on November 30, 2022, the use of LLMs has become commonplace. Writers and content creators alike rely on LLMs to develop anything from videos and images to scripts and story ideas. From drafting an outline for an essay to planning out a tailgating menu for Super Bowl Sunday, the answers people look for are can be found by sharing a well-written prompt with a tool such as ChatGPT or Bard.

However, with the ability to create new content within seconds comes great responsibility. Some students and writers view LLMs as a shortcut, with many using AI to write their essays and books. In response to the rise of AI-generated content on the Kindle, [Amazon capped e-book publications to 3](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/09/ai-generated-books-force-amazon-to-cap-ebook-publications-to-3-per-day/). Moreover, 75% of students in a Turnitin survey said they'd continue using AI, [leading schools such as Pepperdine to introduce tools that can identify AI-generated content](https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/universities-consider-academic-integrity-approach-evolving-ai-filled-future).

With the increased risk of students abusing chatbots and AI tools to cut corners on essays, detecting AI-generated content has become especially important. For today's project, we will utilize BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to predict which essays are written by a human.
